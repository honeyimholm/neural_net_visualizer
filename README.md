# neural_net_visualizer

This project provides a data visualization of the network as it trains. Below we can see a demo of a 2x2x1 network learning the XOR function using stochastic gradient descent over 5000 epochs. The weights are displayed relative in size to each other and color coded red for negative weight and green for positive weight. In the demo I've moused over the error text to reveal the values of the initial error and current error.
